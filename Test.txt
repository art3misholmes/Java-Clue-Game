testRoomLabels:
	We chose every other room as listed in our ClueSetup.txt (except that I forgot we were doing every other room at one point so there are two included in a row)
	
testBoardDimensions:
	We dropped a column and added a row.
	
fourDoorDirections:
	We have a door leading UP into the Studio,
	LEFT into the VIP lounge,
	DOWN into the Kitchen Arena,
	and RIGHT into the test kitchen.
	We picked some random walkway tiles for not having doors.

testNumberOfDoorways:
	Self-explanatory, our map has two fewer doors.
	
testRooms:
	We chose random rooms from our code,
	and also refactored the non-null assertion on board.getRoom
	into a generic function to reduce verbosity.
